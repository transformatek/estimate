E. DEVELOPMENT
==============
1. The user-interface of the application is completely database-driven. User Interface is separate from business logic of the application.
2. Interesting Places:
    a. WEB-INF/classes
    b. Go through com.wanhive.basic package and sub-packages inside the "src" directory to understand the under-lying framework.
    c. themes directory inside the web directory.
    d. "menu" table inside the database schema (search inside WEB-INF/classes directory).
3. Feel free to contact me in case of any query, but only after you have completely exhausted your brain-power.
4. The basic framework itself is use-case neutral, it can be easily modified and can be used for development of any entirely new web-based application.
5. Character sets used: latin-1 in database, ISO-8859-1 in web pages.
6. Documentation is incomplete. Keep looking inside the "Documents" folder.
